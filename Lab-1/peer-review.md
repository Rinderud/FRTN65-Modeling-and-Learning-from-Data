# Peer Review for lab 1

Well done! For me, the presentation you made sums it up pretty well but I would like to see a bit more of your findings to back up your arguments. On the other hand, the notebook is very well structured and super easy to follow so when I first read through that and then the presentation, the presentation seemed a bit flat.  Very well done with the pdf and you definitely include enough to reproduce your findings.

I'm guessing that performance could be boosted if features were more investigated. You write that all features performed better than 4-5 features, but maybe if you would just delete one or two of the "bad" ones it could improve performance. I like your notes from plots section.
Scaling is a good idea!
I think you investigate your data sufficiently but probably could draw another conclusion than to use all features.

Check out GridSearchCV! It does the same thing as your loops but a bit more compact and no need to implement you own for loop. But the looping through parameters is a nice way to find the best parameters. Although it is very computational heavy and if were to be implemented on more data the computational power need would increase! I would like to see some more intuition reasoning and maybe don't need to loop through so many parameters. Your plots often show a pretty flat line which means you use a lot of computational power without gaining much in the performance of the model.

For me explainability also is very important. I guess, as we become more comfortable around these concepts we are more willing to leave it to the computer.

Your evaluation and summary section sums it up very nicely and I think that your motivations are good enough!

I'm very impressed with the structure of your notebook and I had no problem following your reasoning! I also choose the random forest classifier :D. In general a nicely written report.
